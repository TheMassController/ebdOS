Compiler:
ARM-GCC-None-EABI. Download it and extract the folder somewhere. Then set the parameters in arm-gcc-locations. BASH+Make will handle the rest
Download location: https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/
Extract somewhere and update the arm-gcc-locations file in this folder to point to the correct location

Flasing:
For flashing lm4flash is used. This is part of the lm4tools package, which you can find on github:
https://github.com/utzig/lm4tools
Clone it, compile it and place the lm4flash executable on the PATH somewhere (/home/USER/bin?).

Debugging:
Half of the debugging is included in the above: GDB. This will also be handled by BASH and Make
The other half is OpenOCD

Steps to install:
1a. sudo apt-get install git-core libtool autoconf texinfo libusb-dev libusb-1.0 screen vim
1b. sudo pacman -S --needed git-core libtool autoconf texinfo libusb screen vim lib32-glibc 
    You will need to activate 32 bit libraries, since the toolchain is 32 bit. See: 
    https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Migrating_Between_Architectures_Without_Reinstalling#Install_lib32-glibc
2. git clone http://git.code.sf.net/p/openocd/code openocd; cd openocd
3. git checkout v0.7.0
4. ./bootstrap
5. ./configure --enable-maintainer-mode --enable-ti-icdi
6. make -j15 (or less, or no -j at all. Multithreading is pretty amazing, though)
7. sudo make install

Setup udev:
Necessary so that you do not have to be root to flash to the device. You still need to be root for Screen, though.
1. Open the file /etc/udev/rules.d/61.stellpad.rules
2. Write the following into it:
    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1cbe", ATTRS{idProduct}=="00fd", MODE="0666"
3. Restart udev:
    sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
4. Reconnect the stellaris

Screen without sudo:
Add yourself to the group dialout to be able to use the screen command without sudo:
-sudo adduser <name> dialout
-logout and login to apply

Screen command:

screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200

The 0 can be something else, 115200 is the baudrate.

If ACM0 is correct then ./build.sh screen will also suffice.

Well, after everything above is done the file build.sh can handle everything for you. Including:
-make
-make debug
-make clean/distclean
-flash
-debugflash
-launch openOCD
-connect GDB
-and some more

just type ./build.sh help to see all commands. Make sure the arm-gcc-locations file contains the correct paths though. Unless the toolchain is in your PATH, running make directly from proj will not work.
